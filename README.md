For the first week, we were given W3Schools tutorials to brush up on HTML, CSS and JS. They weren't ideal if you were learning those languages for the first time, but as all of us had learned the basics of those languages already, it was fine. There was an assignment based on these topics (a basic shopping cart), and my attempt is in the files in the repo.
For the next two weeks, there were videos for the basics of React and Django, which were quite useful, given the limited time available for the project. There were also videos for the basics of Bootstrap and Figma, which would help in the design part of the project, and a video for the basics of Git.
After this, we'll be starting the more advanced part and actually starting with the project.
